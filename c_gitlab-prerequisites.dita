                    <li>GitLab Runner is an application that works with GitLab CI/CD to run jobs in
                        a pipeline. To use GitLab Runner in your project, you must have the
                        maintainer or owner role for the project.</li>
                    <li>A GitLab runner can be self-managed or SaaS runners managed by GitLab.</li>
                    <li>A GitLab self-managed runner can be installed and used on GNU/Linux, macOS
                        and Windows. For more details refer: <xref

                    <li>To set up project specific self-managed runner, go to (<b>Project
                            Settings</b> → <b>CI/CD</b> → <b>Runners</b>) and configure.</li>
                    <li>During runner registration, choose executor as <codeph>shell</codeph>.</li>
                    <li>Make sure you have curl and unzip package tools installed in
                        self-managed/SaaS runner (Linux/Mac).</li>
                    <li>Synopsys Template supports both Project runners and Shared runners (except
                        Shared Mac Runners).</li>
